# General-microbiome-analysis (Go Tools) # processing

## Description
This repository contains a set of tools for reproducible microbiome analysis. It includes scripts for various purposes, such as data visualization, statistical testing, data transformation, and more.

## List of Tools
The repository includes the following scripts:

- **Go_tools_installpackages.210726_R.4.0.4.R**: A script to install the required packages for the other tools in this suite.
- **rarefaction_function.R**: A script for performing rarefaction analysis, a technique used in ecology to assess species richness from the results of sampling.
- **Go_DA_heatmap_v1.R**: A script used to create heatmaps, a graphical representation of data where values are depicted as colors, for differential abundance (DA) analysis.
- **Go_DA_plot_v2.R**: A script for creating plots to visualize differential abundance analysis results.
- **Go_adiv_V2.R**: A script for alpha diversity computations. Alpha diversity is a measure of diversity within a particular area or ecosystem.
- **Go_alluvialplot_V2.R**: A script for generating alluvial plots, which are a type of flow diagram to represent changes in network structure over time.
- **Go_ancom_plot.R**: A script for creating plots for ANCOM (Analysis of Composition of Microbiomes), a method to determine features that are differentially abundant (or present) between different groups.
- **Go_barchart_v35.R**: A script to generate bar charts.
- **Go_bdiv_V33.R**: A script for computing and visualizing beta diversity. Beta diversity is a comparison of diversity between ecosystems, usually measured as the change in amount of species.
- **Go_biplot_function_V2.R**: A script to create biplots, a type of graph used in statistics to display information from a multivariate dataset.
- **Go_boxplot_V10.R**: A script for generating box plots, a type of graph used to display the distribution of data.
- **Go_cleanMito_V1.R**: A script to clean or filter out mitochondrial sequences from a dataset.
- **Go_correlation_V2.R**: A script to compute and visualize correlations between different variables or features.
- **Go_deseq2fishtaco.R**: ---
- **Go_dist_V4.R**: A script to compute or visualize distance metrics, often used in beta-diversity analysis.
- **Go_filter.R**: A script to filter datasets.
- **Go_function2ps_V2.R**: A script to convert functional profiles (e.g., from metagenomic or metatranscriptomic data) to a phyloseq object, a container for storing and analyzing phylogenetic sequencing data in R.
- **Go_krakenLog.R**: A script to processing or analyzing Kraken output. Kraken is a system for assigning taxonomic labels to short DNA sequences.
- **Go_linear_V4.R**: A script for conducting linear regression analysis.
- **Go_lmem_V7.R**: A script to perform linear mixed-effects model analysis.
- **Go_perm_V16.R**: A script for running permutation tests.
- **Go_pheatmap_V2.R**: A script to generate heatmaps, specifically using the pheatmap function in R which offers more control over heatmap generation.
- **Go_psTotab.R**: A script to convert a phyloseq object to a table for further processing or analysis.
- **Go_regression_V34.R**: A script for performing regression analysis.
- **Go_rf_function_sets.R**: A script for performing random forest analysis, a machine learning technique.

## Usage # processing
The scripts in this repository are written in R. To use these tools, clone the repository and run the scripts using an R environment. Each script is self-contained and can be run independently unless specified otherwise.

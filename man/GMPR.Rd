\title{Calculate Geometric Mean of Pairwise Ratios (GMPR) Size Factors}
\usage{
GMPR(comm, intersect.no = 10, ct.min = 1, trace = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{comm}{A matrix of counts (rows - features like OTUs or genes, columns - samples).}

\item{intersect.no}{Minimum number of shared features between sample pairs for ratio calculation.}

\item{ct.min}{Minimum count threshold for inclusion in ratio calculation.}

\item{trace}{Logical; if TRUE, progress messages will be printed.}
}
\value{
A vector of GMPR size factors. Samples with distinct sets of features will be output as NA.
Includes an attribute 'NSS' indicating the number of samples with significant sharing.
}
\description{
This function computes the GMPR size factors for microbiome sequencing data or zero-inflated sequencing data. The size factors can be used as offsets in count-based regression models or as divisors for normalized data.

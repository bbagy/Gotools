\title{Calculate Alpha Diversity Metrics for Phyloseq Data}
\usage{
Go_adiv_markdown(psIN, project, alpha_metrics)
}
\arguments{
\item{psIN}{A Phyloseq object containing OTU/ASV counts and associated sample data.}

\item{project}{Name or identifier for the project or dataset.}

\item{alpha_metrics}{A character vector specifying the alpha diversity measures to be calculated.
Supported measures include standard diversity indices and Faith's PD.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing calculated alpha diversity metrics for each sample
in the Phyloseq object, merged with the sample data.
}
\description{
This function calculates various alpha diversity metrics for microbiome data
provided in a Phyloseq object. It supports multiple diversity measures and
can include phylogenetic diversity (Faith's PD).
}
\examples{
# Assuming 'ps' is a Phyloseq object and 'project_name' is the project identifier
Go_adiv_markdown(ps, project_name, c("Shannon", "Simpson", "PD"))

}
